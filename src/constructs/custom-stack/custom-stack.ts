/**
 * A reusable CDK stack with optional CloudWatch dashboard integration and widget management.
 *
 * This stack provides a foundation for building monitoring-aware applications by:
 * - Optionally creating a CloudWatch dashboard with descriptive documentation
 * - Managing a collection of widgets that can be added throughout the stack lifecycle
 * - Providing consistent patterns for dashboard integration across different stack types
 * - Following established CDK patterns for prop handling and sensible defaults
 *
 * The stack maintains a registry of all widgets added to it, whether or not a dashboard
 * is created, allowing for flexible monitoring strategies and easy dashboard creation
 * after initial deployment.
 *
 * **Key features:**
 * - **Optional Dashboard**: Dashboard creation can be toggled via `createDashboard` prop
 * - **Widget Registry**: All widgets are tracked internally for later dashboard integration
 * - **Flexible Configuration**: All CloudWatch dashboard properties can be customized
 * - **Sensible Defaults**: Dashboard names and descriptions are auto-generated from stack context
 * - **Lifecycle Management**: Automatic removal policy handling for ephemeral environments
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Basic stack without dashboard
 * const basicStack = new CustomStack(this, 'BasicStack', {
 *   description: 'Basic application stack without monitoring dashboard'
 * });
 *
 * // Add widgets - they're tracked even without a dashboard
 * basicStack.addWidget(
 *   new cloudwatch.GraphWidget({
 *     title: 'API Requests',
 *     left: [apiMetric],
 *   })
 * );
 *
 * // Stack with dashboard and custom configuration
 * const monitoredStack = new CustomStack(this, 'MonitoredStack', {
 *   createDashboard: true,
 *   dashboardName: 'production-monitoring',
 *   dashboardDescription: 'Production application monitoring dashboard',
 *   dashboardRemovalPolicy: cdk.RemovalPolicy.RETAIN,
 *   env: { region: 'us-east-1' },
 *   initialWidgets: [
 *     new cloudwatch.GraphWidget({
 *       title: 'Error Rate',
 *       left: [errorMetric],
 *       width: 12,
 *       height: 6,
 *     }),
 *   ],
 * });
 *
 * // Add widgets dynamically during stack construction
 * monitoredStack.addWidgets([
 *   new cloudwatch.SingleValueWidget({
 *     title: 'Total Requests',
